# Multithreaded Tracker.GG Viewbot

**PROJECT STILL WORKS AFTER TRACKER.GG CAPTCHA IMPLEMENTATION**  

Kindly ⭐ the project to show your support. Your interest motivates further updates!

## About the Project

This is the final release of the project. Unfortunately, earlier versions have been ripped off and sold as "viewbotting as a service" (for $5/1000 views). Ridiculous, given that with $2-3 worth of datacenter proxies, you can generate 500k views in a day.

At this point, it doesn’t matter if this gets ripped and resold again—skidders will be skidders. The rest of you, **ENJOY**!

> **Note:** I will not be responding to basic questions like:  
> - "Where do I put the proxies?"  
> - "Why does it not load?"  
> - "How do I run it?"  
> 
> Use **ChatGPT** or **Google** for simple inquiries. If you struggle to get it running, I can assist on a VPS for a $10 fee to avoid spamming my inbox.

### Why even make this project?:
* Affordable and easy way to make your tracker profile appear more “legit.”
* High demand project, first publicly available solution.
* Gamerdoc promised me an EV certificate.

This project serves as a **base** but is easy to modify to your needs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zaptons/multithreaded-trackergg-viewbot-.git
Install requirements:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Edit the config file: Update the configuration details to match your setup.

Add Proxies: I recommend rotating datacenter proxies as they are cost-effective and perform well.
You can use proxies from Kocerroxy.
For $2/day, you can run 250 threads of rotating proxies, enough for 500k views if running continuously for 24 hours.
